### Javascript
Basic usage:
```javascript
const pil = await compile(Fr, "pil/main.pil");
```
Advanced usage:
```javascript
const pilConfig =
    { defines: {N: 2 ** 21},
      namespaces: ['Global', 'Main', 'Rom', 'Byte4', 'Arith'],
      verbose: true,
      color: true,
      disableUnusedError: true});

const pil = await compile(Fr, "pil/main.pil", null,  pilConfig);
```
- **define**: object (key, value) with constants to define, if constant is defined in pil, use value specified on config and shown a warning during compilation.
- **namespaces**: list of namespace used, if namespace not present in this list, it will be ignored, and warning was shown. If any namespace of list, not was found in pils and exception was produced.
- **verbose**: source code ignored inside a namespace was shown (first 3 lines).
